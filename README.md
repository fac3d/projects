### Project Title
#### Learning to 'git'. Though a project should really have a 'code name', no pun intented.

### Project Summary
#### Contains code snippets and examples. Much of these were coded on the weekend as learning projects.  

### Directory Summary

### screenshots
#### Contains screenshots (png) files of various Python learning projects. Source code not in github.

### PERL
#### Several PERL scripts including those that have created the user interfaces shown below.

### Python
#### This contains a bunch of python scripts that were coded on a Rasberry PI which interfaced to GPIO. Sending signals to LED's and so forth. It is pretty much just a jumble of files.

### c_examples
#### This directory is fairly empty at this time. Eventually would contain lots of good quality c programs and functions to demonstrate use of c code. Examples would be directory operations, file operations, string operations, time operations, shared memory.

### sqlite
#### SQLite is awesome, however, this directory is also empty. Scripts that open, close, read, write, delete and other SQLite operations would go here.

### doc
#### Pretty sure doc directory is also empty.

### java
#### Contains two directories, RMI and Polymorphism. Both have example files and show the very basic of concepts.

#### Screen shot of a PERL gui program showing a table. What is cool about this is using PERL to create this table and push buttons that actually update the table. Have not looked at the code in awhile. Pretty sure it hits a SQLite database.

#### Screen shot of a PERL gui program used to update the above table. When coding the above program, that table needed a means to update various recodes. A standalone PERL script was the chosen solution.

#### Screen shot of a PERL gui program containing buttons and text areas. The buttons on the left side of the display area invoke subroutines which update in the scrolling text box at the bottom. A function that send a .png file into the display area as an overall demonstration effort.
