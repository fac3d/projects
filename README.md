# Project Title
Learning to 'git'. Though a project should really have a 'code name', no pun intented.

## Project Summary
### Contains code snippets and examples. Much of these were coded on the weekend as learning projects.  

## Directory Summary
### PERL
#### Several PERL scripts including those that have created the user interfaces shown below.

### Python
#### This contains a bunch of python scripts that were coded on a Rasberry PI which interfaced to GPIO. Sending signals to LED's and so forth. It is pretty much just a jumble of files.

### c_examples
#### This directory is fairly empty at this time. Eventually would contain lots of good quality c programs and functions to demonstrate use of c code. Examples would be directory operations, file operations, string operations, time operations, shared memory.

### sqlite
#### SQLite is awesome, however, this directory is also empty. Scripts that open, close, read, write, delete and other SQLite operations would go here.

### doc
#### Pretty sure doc directory is also empty.
