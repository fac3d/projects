#### This is the PERL Directory.

### Directory Summary
### PERL
#### Several PERL scripts including those that have created the user interfaces shown below.

#### Screen shot of a PERL gui program showing a table. What is cool about this is using PERL to create this table and push buttons that actually update the table. Have not looked at the code in awhile. Pretty sure it hits a SQLite database.

#### Screen shot of a PERL gui program used to update the above table. When coding the above program, that table needed a means to update various recodes. A standalone PERL script was the chosen solution.

#### Screen shot of a PERL gui program containing buttons and text areas. The buttons on the left side of the display area invoke subroutines which update in the scrolling text box at the bottom. A function that send a .png file into the display area as an overall demonstration effort.
